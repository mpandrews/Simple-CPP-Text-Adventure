# Simple CPP Text Adventure

This was a course assignment.

It's nothing special, just a simplified parser-less text adventure intended to make use of inheritance, polymorphism, and file reads.  All the same I was pretty happy with how it came together.

It will compile under linux with g++ or clang++, but will not compile or run under Windows.  Note that the executable depends on the provided textfiles to run; they act as string libraries for the game.
