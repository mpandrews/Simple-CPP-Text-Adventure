# CS-162-Final-Project

Final project for the second introductory CS course. 

Nothing special, just a simplified parser-less text adventure intended to make use of inheritance, polymorphism, and file reads.

It will compile under linux with GCC or clang, but will not compile or run under Windows.  Note that the executable depends on the provided textfiles to run; they act as string libraries for the game.
