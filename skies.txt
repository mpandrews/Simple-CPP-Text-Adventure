//All sky descriptors should begin with a space.

$0$ The sky here is completely black, with no stars or moons.  It's a little agoraphobic.$

$1$ The sky here flashes wildly between blue and crimson.$

$2$ The sun here is moving at a prodigious pace, with a day/night cycle measured in seconds.$

$3$ The sky here is a giant eye, staring down at the world.$

$4$ The sky here is a tesselation of hexagons, like the roof of some vast geodesic dome.$

$5$ The sky here is a tacky orange.$

$6$ The sky here is a distorted reflection of the ground below; the top of your head subtends almost a full radian, and although it's hard to get a clean look while keeping your head level, you think it suggests that you might be losing more of your hair than you wanted to think.$

$7$ The sky here is just a pattern of magenta and black squares.$

$8$ The sky here is black with what you think are meant to be passenger pigeons, but it's a little hard to be sure.$

$9$ The sky here is bood red.$

$10$ The sky here is a dark green, with vibrant blue clouds.$

$11$ The sky here is pink, with yellow polka-dots.$

$12$ The sky here is a blown up version of the Treachery of Images, by Rene Magritte.  The symbolism is a little bit on the nose, you think, and the Holodeck ought to be ashamed of itself.$

$13$ The sky here is... pretty normal.  Light blue, moderate cloud cover.$

$14$ Two armadas of flying saucers appear to be having a battle overhead.  The great fusillades of negative scratches look devastating, or at least detrimental to the physical integrity of the film.$

$15$ The sky here is an uninspiring brown.$

$16$ The sky here is a bright blue, with white writing reading, "A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer."$

$17$ The sky here is green with white stripes.$

$18$ The sky here is white with green stripes.$

$18$ The sky here is a charming mauve.$

$19$ The sky here is eggshell, or possibly ecru.$

$20$ The sky here is blood red.$

$21$ The sky here is chartreuse.$

$22$ The sky here is tartan; you think possibly Black Watch.$

$23$ The sky here is a normal blue, but the clouds are Sierpiknsi triangles.$

$24$ Above you, the sky is a blue tarpaulin, billowing in an invisible breeze.$

$25$ The sky above you appears to be the inside of an armillary sphere, with some unspeakably vast library beyond.$

$26$ Above you, the sky is full of dolphins, frockiling and squeaking in the air.$

$27$ The sky here appears to be a map of the Isle of Skye.$
